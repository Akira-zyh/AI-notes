# 过拟合(Overfitting)

> [!important] From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting)
> **Overfitting** is the production of an analysis that **corresponds too closely or exactly to a particular set of data**, and **may therefore fail to fit to additional data or predict future observations reliably**.

## Essence of Overfitting

> [!important]  From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting)
> 1. The **overfitted** model have **unknowingly** extracted some of the residual variation.
> 2. The **overfitted** model ==contains more parameters than can be justified by data==.
> 3. The **overfitted** mode **simply memorize the training data** rather than learning to generalize from a trend

## Ways to reduce Overfitting

- Model Comparison
- Cross Validation 
- Regularization
- Early Stopping
- Pruning
- Bayesian Priors
- Dropout

# 欠拟合(Underfitting)


> [!important] From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting)
> **Underfitting** occurs **when the model cannot adequately the underlying structure of the data**.

## Essence of Underfitting


> [!important] From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting)
> An **under-fitted model** is a model where **some parameters or terms are missing, which ==would appear in a correctly specified model==**
